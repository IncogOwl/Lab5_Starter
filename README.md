1. If you are using a singular unit test, No. Since the messaging feature has several different aspects and functions running through it that a singular unit test will not be able to test each individual parts of the feature. There would be a unit test to check if it recieved or sent a message and many more things. This would require multiple unit tests and not a single test
2. Yes, since this is a constant factor in the application and is a reproducible constant that should be tested and ensured in the application. It's very easy to write a unit test that checks if max message length is maintained or not and it is a singular aspect of a feature that is testes thus yes a unit test would be used to it.
